    "# Notebook 2: RAG Pipeline Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook demonstrates how to use the complete RAG pipeline to ask questions and get answers based on the previously built vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisite:** Ensure that `01_data_preprocessing_and_embedding.ipynb` (or `python main.py build`) has been run successfully to create the `vector_store_index/faiss_index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Setup: Import necessary libraries and configure paths.\n",
    "2. Initialize RAG Pipeline: Create an instance of `RAGPipeline` from `src.rag_pipeline`.\n",
    "3. Ask Questions: Use the `ask()` method of the pipeline.\n",
    "4. Review Results: Examine the generated answer and retrieved source documents."
